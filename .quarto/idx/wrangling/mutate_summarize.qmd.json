Here's a video from Christian McDonald that explains it [with candy](https://youtu.be/a3VNWYJoy5A).\n\nSo the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions do the aggregation process in two steps. \n\nFirst we use `group_by()` to tell R which columns we want to group our data by - these are the higher level of aggregation columns so in our case will be the year of data. \n\nThen we need to determine the number of declarations each year. We do this using `summarize()`, and we’ll specify in the function that we want to do to the data. We're going to use the `n()` function which is just \"number of.\"\n\nHere's how it looks.

That's not accurate for what we're trying to measure.\n\nLet me show you how off our analysis would be if we used **fyDeclared** instead of creating a new column.\n\nWe're going to use a **dplyr** function called `case_when()` which is used within the `mutate()` function.\n\nIt's a powerful way to vectorize multiple if/else statements.\n\nWhat we want to do is create a new column called **year_match** that will indicate if the **year** column we created from **declarationDate** matches the value in the **fyDeclared** column.\n\nIf it matches, then mark it \"Match\" otherwise mark it as \"Not a match\".\n\nThe syntax is a [little tricky](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1282785610273447936) but check it out below.\n\nFill in the new function name below:\n\n::: { .panel-tabset}\n\n## Exercise\n```{webr case_when}\n#| exercise: case_when\nfloods_match <- floods_adjusted |> \n  mutate(year_match=\n           _________(year==fyDeclared ~ \"Match\",\n                     TRUE ~ \"Not a match\"\n  )) |> \n  group_by(year_match) |> \n  summarize(total=n())\n\nfloods_match\n```\n\n## Hint\n\n::: { .hint exercise=\"case_when\"}\nfunction starts with an *c*.\n:::\n\n## Solution\n\n::: { .solution exercise=\"case_when\"}\n\n```{webr case_when-solution}\n#| exercise: case_when\n#| solution: true\nfloods_match <- floods_adjusted |> \n  mutate(year_match=\n           case_when(year==fyDeclared ~ \"Match\",\n                     TRUE ~ \"Not a match\"\n  )) |> \n  group_by(year_match) |> \n  summarize(total=n())\n\nfloods_match\n```\n\n\n```{webr case_when-check}\n#| exercise: case_when\n#| check: true\ngradethis::grade_this_code()\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\nThe `TRUE ~ \"Not a match\"` is essentially, \"if none of the criteria fit from above, then fill the rest out as 'Not a match'\".\n\nSo there are more than 1,400 disasters that occurred on a fiscal year that didn't line up with the actual year.\n\n## Pull\n\n**What's the percent of that in the data?**\n\nYou could just pop the numbers you generated into a calculator and come up with the value but this data set is updated regularly so the number is going to change!\n\nLet's just script it out now so you can get the number really quickly in the future.\n\nIt's a time investment to set it up but it'll save you time in the long run.\n\nFirst, we need to take out the number for \"Not a match\"\n\nWe'll use a function called `pull()` that will isolate the values from whatever column you indicate.\n\nTry it below.\n\n::: { .panel-tabset}\n\n## Exercise\n\n```{webr pull}\n#| exercise: pull\nfloods_match_count <- floods_match |> \n  filter(year_match==\"Not a match\") |> \n  ____(total)\n\nfloods_match_count\n```\n\n## Hint\n\n::: { .hint exercise=\"pull\"}\nfunction starts with an *p*.\n:::\n\n## Solution\n\n::: { .solution exercise=\"pull\"}\n```{webr pull-solution}\n#| exercise: pull\n#| solution: true\nfloods_match_count <- floods_match |> \n  filter(year_match==\"Not a match\") |> \n  pull(total)\n\nfloods_match_count\n```\n\n\n```{webr pull-check} \n#| exercise: pull\n#| check: true\ngradethis::grade_this_code()\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\nWe have that number isolated so let's use that with the `nrow()` function you learned earlier to get the denominator you need to establish the percent.\n\nWe'll also use a new function `round()` to get a prettier number that doesn't have so many trailing digits after the decimal.\n\nIt works like this: `round(4.12423212311, 1)` with the first argument being the number or numbers you're working with and the second argument is the digits after the decimal you want to keep.
