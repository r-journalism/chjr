If the year is 2020, then it will be \"2020\" otherwise it will be \"1997-2020\".

And then we find the average number of deaths for each month for those two groups.\n\n```{webr sd_group}\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nsd_group <- sd_adjusted |> \n  filter(!month %in% c(\"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")) |> \n  count(year, month, manner_of_death, name=\"deaths\") |> \n  mutate(year_type=case_when(\n    year==2020 ~ \"2020\",\n    TRUE ~ \"1997-2019\"\n  )) |> \n  group_by(month, manner_of_death, year_type) |> \n  summarize(avg_deaths=mean(deaths, na.rm=T)) |> \n  filter(!is.na(month))\n\ndatatable(sd_group)\n```\n\nLooking very smooth.\n\nLet's chart it.\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nCan you please create a faceted line chart of the data above? But with year_type as two different lines?\n\nFill in the three blanks to generate the chart.\n\n```{webr sd_group_viz}\n#| exercise: sd_group_viz\n#| fig.width: 8\n#| fig.height: 5\nggplot(sd_group, aes(x=_____, y=__________, color=year_type, group=year_type)) +\n  geom_____() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(manner_of_death), scales=\"free_y\", ncol=2)\n```\n\n```{webr sd_group_viz-solution}\n#| exercise: sd_group_viz\n#| solution: true\nggplot(sd_group, aes(x=month, y=avg_deaths, color=year_type, group=year_type)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(manner_of_death), scales=\"free_y\", ncol=2)\n```\n\nGreat.\n\nNow there's some interesting trend in July and August, right?\n\nAnd it shows that maybe the last month of data is so low. It's possible that the data for the month is incomplete and should be excluded from analysis.\n\n**How about we come up with a number for the nutgraf of a story?**\n\nHow many more accidental cause deaths are there in 2020 compared to the historical average?\n\n*Exclude September since it seems so off*\n\nHere's a look at the dataframe you can estimate this with.\n\n```{webr glimpse}\ndatatable(sd_group)\n```\n\nWhat code do you put below to fill out this sentence:\n\n\"There were X% more accidental deaths in 2020 so far than the historical average in San Diego\"\n\n*hint: you'll need filter(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), summarize(), mutate(), and math*\n\n```{webr excess_deaths}\n#| exercise: excess_deaths\nsd_group |> \n  \n```\n\nGood job!\n\n### Further exploratory visual analysis\n\nAlright, comparing 2020 to the average from previous years seems to be a good decision.\n\nSome interesting trends that we could actually write about are surfacing.\n\nLet's compare that overall instead of by month.\n\nHere's the code. We're also excluding September based on what we discovered in the chart above.\n\n```{webr sd_group_compare}\nsd_group_compare <- sd_adjusted |> \n  filter(!month %in% c(\"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")) |> \n  count(year, manner_of_death, name=\"deaths\") |> \n  mutate(year_type=case_when(\n    year==2020 ~ \"2020\",\n    TRUE ~ \"1997-2019\"\n  )) |> \n  group_by(manner_of_death, year_type) |> \n  summarize(avg_deaths=round(mean(deaths, na.rm=T)))\n\ndatatable(sd_group_compare)\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 11\n\nRun the code below with `manner_of_death` as x and `avg_deaths` as y.\n\nThen swap them.\n\nWhich do you prefer and why?\n\n```{webr sd_group_compare_chart}\n#| exercise: sd_group_compare\nggplot(sd_group_compare, aes(x=________, y=______, fill=year_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") \n```\n\n\n```{webr sd_group_compare_chart-solution}\n#| exercise: sd_group_compare\n#| solution: true\nggplot(sd_group_compare, aes(x=manner_of_death, y=avg_deaths, fill=year_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") \n```\n\n\n```{webr sd_group_compare_chart-code-check}\n#| exercise: sd_group_compare\n#| check: true\ngradethis::grade_this_code()\n```\n\n\nAlright, before we go, I want to clean things up some.\n\nI want to get rid of the manners of death that have barely any and I want to reorder the labels so that it's in alphabetical order.\n\n### Exercise 12\n\nTake a look at the code below. Absorb it.\n\nThen generate the code and see what pops up.\n\n```{webr sd_group_compare_chart_new}\n#| exercise: sd_group_compare_chart_new\nsd_group_compare |> \n  filter(!manner_of_death %in% c(\"Other\", \"Family Paid Autopsy\")) |> \n  filter(!is.na(manner_of_death)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x=avg_deaths, y=forcats::fct_rev(manner_of_death),  fill=year_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  labs(title=\"Manner of death in San Diego\",\n       subtitle=\"January and August deaths in 2020 compared to average deaths between 1997 and 2019\",\n       caption=\"Source: San Diego Medical Examiner\",\n       y=\"Manner of death\",\n       x=\"Average deaths\",\n       fill=\"Year\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n```\n\n### Story\n\nSo, what do you think the story is?\n\nIn San Diego, accidents are way up, suicides are slightly up, and meanwhile homicides are down.\n\nWhat can we do next?\n\nWell, dig into the accidents, perhaps, and see if there's any explanation for the huge increase.\n\nAlright, congratulations on going on this exploratory data visualization journey.\n\nSome of the answers won't appear right away unless you poke around and look at the data in as many ways as possible.\n"},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/andrewtran/Projects/chjr/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"output-file":"exploratory_viz.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
