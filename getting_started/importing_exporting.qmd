## CSV files

Comma separated files are the most common way to save spreadsheets that doesn't require a paid program from Microsoft to open.

### What a csv file looks like

CSV file names end with a **.csv**

### What a csv file looks like on the inside**

This explains the values separated with commas part of the file name.

## Importing CSV files

- Importing CSV is part of base R, no package needed
- But we're going to use a package anyway, **readr**

**Two ways to get data**

* If you have the URL address
    * If the csv file exists on the internet, you don’t have to download it to your local machine and then import it, you can import it to R directly from the web using the link
* If you have the file on your computer

### Get the URL

If you have the link to a CSV file, right click [the link](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/data) of the data and click **Copy Link Address**. This data set can be found on the [Connecticut Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/). **NOTE:** This data is no longer available. Download it instead from [here](https://www.andrewbatran.com/data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv).

![](images/rightclick.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

### read.csv()

The Base R function to import a CSV file is `read.csv()`. Just put the URL address in quotation marks and add the `stringsAsFactors=F` (In this code we're using the function `head()`-- this returns 6 rows by default, but we want to look at 10, so we’ll specify that when we call the function head(data, 10))

Click `RUN CODE` to import the data from a  website and look at the first 10 rows.

```{webr}
#df_csv <- read.csv("https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&api_foundry=true", stringsAsFactors=F)

df <- read.csv("https://www.andrewbatran.com/data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)


head(df_csv, 10)
```


### Other way: Download it first

When you right click on the link, instead of clicking **Copy Link Address**-- this time, click **Save Link As...**

![](images/downloading.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

Save to your working directory.

After saving to the directory, click on the circle arrow on the right to refresh the files to make sure it's there.

![](images/directory.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

### Recall: How to change directories in RStudio

Either by typing `setwd("/directory/where/you/want")` or by clicking in the menu up top **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...**

![](images/setwd.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

### Importing local csv data

Just like before, except instead of the URL, it's the name of the file.

**Note:** This will only work if the working directory is set to where the csv file is.

### Using read_csv() from the readr package

**readr** is a package that read rectangular data quickly and assumes characters are strings and not factors by default.

```{webr segment4}
## If you don't have readr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
df_csv <- read_csv("https://www.andrewbatran.com/data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv")

```

As you can see, the `read_csv()` function interpreted the **MonthYear** and **Town** columns as characters and not as Factors as `read.csv()` did.

## Exporting CSV files

When you're done analyzing or transforming your data, you can save your dataframe as a CSV file with `write_csv()` from the **readr** package.

```{r export1, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "transformed_data.csv")
```

The file will save to your working directory, but you can specify sub directories with the function.

```{r export2, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv")
```

### Exporting data frames with `NA` 

Weird quirk alert: Exported files will include `NA`s so to replace them, pass the variable `na="whatever"`. 

```{r export3, eval=F}
# This replaces the NAs with blanks
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", na="")
```


## Your turn

**When exporting a csv, how do you get rid of NAs with the readr package?**

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
mutable ok_reponse1 = (reponse, n) => { return html`Loading...` };
viewof reponse1 = Inputs.radio(
  new Map([
    ['write.csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", is.na=F)', 1],
    ['write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", N.A="")', 2],
    ['write.csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", na="")', 3],
    ['write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", na="")', 4]
  ])
);
ok_reponse1(reponse1, 4);
```


## Importing an Excel file

Excel spreadsheets are unique in that they can contain multiple spreadsheets as a workbook.

### What an Excel file looks like

Excel file names end with a **.xls** or **.xlsx**

![](images/excel1.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

### What an Excel file looks like on the inside

Weird, right? Definitely difficult to parse.

![](images/excel2.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

What I do sometimes (often) is save a sheet from Excel as a .csv file.

That's a short cut. But if you want to be transparent and really deal with the raw data then:

## Importing Excel files
- Importing Excel is complicated, **readxl package** is needed
- There are more other packages that handle Excel files and can build extra sheets, but we won't be needing them for this instance

First, install the `readxl` package if you have not yet done so. 

That will have `readxl` as part of the group of packages.

```{webr segment3a}
## If you don't have readxl installed, uncomment the line below and run it 
#install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

Unlike a csv, you can't just copy and paste the URL for an Excel sheet. 

You gotta download the file first.

Visit this link of [Excel data link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sf7rjfsstsm1520z0xhum/StatisticsSummary.xls?dl=0&rlkey=j8frar23albdjx1b006onm48s) on Dropbox and click **Download**



### read_excel()

Excel spreadsheets have multiple sheets and it's best to explore what it looks like in Excel first because `read_excel()` requires specific sheets to be referred to when importing.

Give it a shot with the first sheet.

```
df_xl <- read_excel("data/StatisticsSummary.xls", sheet=1)
```

Check it

```
View(df_xl)
```

![](images/excel_imported.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}


**This isn't right**. 

## Dealing with ugly data

The problem with Excel files is that people love to format it in ways that make it look nice in Excel but makes no sense in R.

### read_excel() again


But this time we'll add `skip=2` so it skips the first rows when bringing in the data.

```{webr skip}
df_xl <- read_excel("data/StatisticsSummary.xls", sheet=1, skip=2)
```

Much better

```
View(df_xl)
```

![](images/excel_imported2.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

*Notice that the column names are preserved with spaces and symbols.*



```{webr df_xl}
# the colnames() function lists the column names of the dataframe
colnames(df_xl)
```

So how would one refer to the data in the columns with spaces

If we did it like normal with the `$` to pull the column we'd try

```{webr df_xl_col_fail}
head(df_xl$Other Cases)
```

See, spaces won't work. This is how to deal with columns with spaces-- add the back tick next to the 1 button on your keyboard.

```{webr df_xl_col_pass}
head(df_xl$`Other Cases`)
```

It's some extra finger work that you might be okay with if it was in a limited basis.

However, in anticipation of the work we're going to be doing, we should go ahead and simplify the column names so there are no characters or spaces. We're going to load a new package called **[janitor](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/)**. Its job is to exclusively clean names.

```{webr janitor, warning=F, message=F}
#install.packages("janitor")

library(janitor)

df_xl <- clean_names(df_xl)

colnames(df_xl)
```

Compare the column names from this to the ones above. There are no capitalization and the spaces are replaced with `_` and this will be much easier to work with in R.

## Exporting to Excel

It's preferable to save data frames as CSVs because it's more open and doesn't require a paid program for others to open.

But sometimes it's more economical to push out a bunch of sheets into one workbook (that's the perk of Excel, after all).

We won't get into that now but if you're curious, you can explore that in the the links below.

## Your turn again

**If you import an Excel file and it has 5 buffer rows at the top before the real data starts, how do you deal with that using the *readxl* package?**

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
mutable ok_reponse2 = (reponse, n) => { return html`Loading...` };
viewof reponse2 = Inputs.radio(
  new Map([
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=5)', 1],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, skip=5)', 2],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=6)', 3],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=4)', 4]
  ])
);
ok_reponse2(reponse2, 2);
```

**If you import an Excel file and it has 5 buffer rows at the top before the real data starts, how do you deal with that using the *readxl* package?**

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
mutable ok_reponse3 = (reponse, n) => { return html`Loading...` };
viewof reponse3 = Inputs.radio(
  new Map([
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=5)', 1],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, skip=5)', 2],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=6)', 3],
    ['read_excel("stats.xls", sheet=1, row=4)', 4]
  ])
);
ok_reponse3(reponse3, 2);
```

**What is the function from the janitor package that eliminates spaces and lowercases the text in the column names?**


```{ojs}
//| echo: false
mutable ok_reponse4 = (reponse, n) => { return html`Loading...` };
viewof reponse4 = Inputs.radio(
  new Map([
    ['janitor()', 1],
    ['fix_columns()', 2],
    ['make.names()', 3],
    ['clean_names()', 4]
  ])
);
ok_reponse4(reponse4, 4);
```

## Done!

Great job.
